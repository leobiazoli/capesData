# capesData: Data on Scholarships in CAPES International Mobility Programs <img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="Hex logo for package" align="right" width="120"/>

The goal of capesData is to provide an attractive dataset for exploring and visualizing data on the International Mobility Programs funded by CAPES/Brazil. The CAPES database refers to international mobility programs for the period from 2010 to 2019.

## Installation

You can install the development version of capesData from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("leobiazoli/capesData")
```

## About the data

Data were collected from the CAPES/Brazil (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior) [https://dadosabertos.capes.gov.br/dataset/](open%20data%20portal), referring to the international mobility programs from 2010 to 2019 funded by CAPES/Brazil.

The `capesData` package contains two datasets.

```{r}
library(capesData)
```

We will also load the `tidyverse` package for pretty printing of tibbles and some code examples.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

One is called `capesData`, and is a simplified version of the raw data; see `?capesData` for more info:

```{r}
capesData
```

The second dataset is `capesData_raw`, and contains all the variables and original names as downloaded; see `?capesData_raw` for more info.

```{r}
capesData_raw
```

## Examples

```{r}
capesData |>
  count(NM_NIVEL)

capesData |>
  count(NM_GRANDE_AREA)
```
